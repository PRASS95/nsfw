# Not Safe FrameWork

`NSFW` is a framework dedicated to interactive and creative front-end developpment.

## Usage
Put the `NSFW` files in your sources path and create an alias toward `akfn`. Then you will be able to use any of `NSFW` tools this way:

```
import ClassNSFW from 'akfn/nsfw/customPath/ClassNSFW'

```

`NSFW` is written using `ECMAScript 6`, you may need to transpile your final bundle to fit with old browsers requirements.
